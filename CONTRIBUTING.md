Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

## Issues, milestones and stories
All your hard work is tracked using *issues*.

In addition to issues, *milestones* are used to track collection of related *issues* towards a particular goal. As an example, all **Use Cases** are managed as *milestones*. Please review current *milestones* for examples.

The *milestones* that track specific **Use Cases** may contain specific user journeys. In this project, the user journeys are referred to as **stories** and are signified by labels. You can use the labels ~use_case and ~story to the user journey issues.

## Labels

The use of labels in issues is encouraged but not required. The following useful labels are already created and can be used in issues. Using labels helps with filtering, tracking and reporting.

| **Label** | **Guidelines** |
| ----------| --------------- |
| `P::0/1/2` | Priority (scoped label) |
| `status:todo/doing` | will work or working on it (like Kanban or Dev Board) |
| `build`	| something that hasnâ€™t been built yet |
| `fix`		| something built that needs fixing |
| `polish`	| something working that could be better |
| `build_error` | for tracking errors during initial builds |
| `docs`		| documentation |
| `customer`	| customer reference |
| `canceled`	|	was planned at one point but will not happen |
| `platform`, `use_case`, `story`	| self explanatory |
