## Issues, milestones and stories
All your hard work is tracked using *issues*.

In addition to issues, *milestones* are used to track collection of related *issues* towards a particular goal. As an example, all **Use Cases** are managed as *milestones*. Please review current *milestones* for examples.

The *milestones* that track specific **Use Cases** may contain specific user journeys. In this project, the user journeys are referred to as **stories** and are signified by labels. You can use the label ~use_case~ and ~story~ to the user journey issues.

## labels

The use of labels in issues is encouraged but not required. The following useful labels are already created and can be used in issues. Using labels helps with filtering, tracking and reporting.
